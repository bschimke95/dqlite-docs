If you want to see Dqlite in action, please check out the [demo program](https://github.com/canonical/go-dqlite#demo) that comes with the Go Dqlite bindings. For details about Dqlite's internals see the [architecture](https://dqlite.io/docs/architecture) notes, the [consistency model](https://dqlite.io/docs/consistency-model) description and the [replication](https://dqlite.io/docs/replication) mechanics. Alternatively, you can watch the [talk about Dqlite](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dqlite/) that was given at FOSDEM 2020.

If you’re writing an application please refer to the Dqlite C [header file](https://github.com/canonical/dqlite/blob/master/include/dqlite.h) or the [go-dqlite](https://github.com/canonical/go-dqlite) Go bindings.

If you’re writing a Dqlite client for a new language, please refer to the [wire protocol](https://dqlite.io/docs/protocol) description.
